# Training Efficiency Dashboard | Power BI

Interactive dashboard analyzing training efficiency (cost, completion, satisfaction) across providers.

## 📊 Overview
- **KPIs:** Total Cost, Avg Cost per Trainee, Completion Rate, Cancellation Rate, Avg Rating  
- **Visuals:** Cost by Provider, Completed Trainings by Month, slicers by Year/Status/Department/Provider

## 🧩 Dataset
Synthetic maritime training data (courses, providers, status, dates, costs).  
*Note:* “Unknown Provider” reflects missing values kept visible for data-quality transparency.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Data modeling (Date ↔ Training, 1:* relationship)
- DAX measures for KPIs and rates
- Power Query cleaning (locale-safe numeric parsing, filling missing categories)
- Visual design & storytelling (insight panel, slicers, layout)

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Unknown Provider** ≈ 30% of total cost → data completeness opportunity.  
- **RelyOn Nutec** ≈ 20% of spend with solid outcomes.  
- **Completion 70.6%**, **Cancellations 11.7%**, **Avg rating 4.3⭐**.
